## About the project

Project developed during the course "JavaScript: manipulando o DOM", at Alura formation on JavaScript. The objective of this course was to use JavaScript to select specific HTML tags, manipulate them and interact with the document, showing the results of this interaction.

The idea is let the user choose the amount of components to be built in the robot and thus changing its statistics.

## Technologies

For this projected, the initial HTML and CSS codes were given, so that JS was the language chosen to operate the manipulation of the document.

Later a challenge was given to add a feature to change the color of the robot, so some changes in the HTML and CSS had to be made in order to adapt the project for the new feature.

## Access

You can access the project here: https://robotron2000-ecru.vercel.app/.

## Experience

The project was an important opportunity to apply knowledge about some selectors, data attributes and objects. 

Also, since the challenge given had only the feature specified, we could implement it the way we wanted. I tried to do it writing as little code as possible, aiming for a simple, but functional application.
